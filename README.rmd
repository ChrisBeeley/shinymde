# Goals of `shinymde`

`shinymde` provides an application (user interface) to ease the process of missing data exploration. The core functionality accessed is programmed in the code only package [mde](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/mde). It is hoped that this will provide an even easier way to explore missing data.

# Currently Implemented features 

- [x] Summary of missingness

This uses [mde](https://nelson-gon.github.io/mde)'s `na_summary` function to 
generate a simple missingness report. The user can also download this report for 
use in other purposes. 

- [x] Recoding as NA and recoding NA as 

This allows a user to recode a given value as `NA`, R's handler of missing values
or convert `NA`s to some other value. It uses `mde`'s `recode_*` functions. 


- [ ] Missingness plots

# Features that need further development (help)

If you would like to work on this project, here is a features list that could
be a good place to start.

- [ ] Add hovers to user input 

- [ ] Switchable dark mode 

- [ ] Control `pattern_type`/`subset_cols` choice in `na_summary`.

- [ ] Use cached filename in input filename if a user quits the program.

Thank you and keep building,
